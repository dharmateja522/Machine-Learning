# Hotel Booking Prediction

## Problem Statement

### Background

The hotel industry relies on accurate booking predictions to optimize operations, manage resources effectively, and enhance the guest experience. By analyzing historical booking data, machine learning models can be built to predict whether a booking is likely to be canceled. This capability helps hotels make informed decisions and allocate resources efficiently.

### Dataset Information

This project uses the "Hotel Bookings" dataset, which includes information about bookings at two hotels: a resort hotel and a city hotel. The dataset contains features such as guest demographics, booking details, room type, meal arrangement, and booking status (canceled or not). This comprehensive dataset is crucial for building effective prediction models.

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled based on various features in the dataset. We aim to develop a machine learning model that helps hotel management understand booking patterns, optimize resource allocation, improve revenue management, and enhance guest experiences by handling bookings more efficiently.

## Approach

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns.
   - Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
   - Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant columns and filtering invalid records.
   - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features for model compatibility.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features as needed, such as the total number of nights stayed.
   - Analyze feature correlations and select relevant features for model training.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train various machine learning models using algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, Extra Trees, LGBM, and Voting Classifier.
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

4. **Model Comparison and Selection**
   - Compare model performance to identify the most accurate and reliable model for prediction.
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

5. **Model Deployment and Usage**
   - Deploy the selected model to a production environment or integrate it into hotel management systems.
   - Utilize the model for real-time prediction of booking cancellations.
   - Monitor and analyze model performance regularly for effectiveness and make adjustments as needed.

## Framework

1. **Importing Required Libraries**
   - Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

2. **Loading the Dataset**
   - Read the "Hotel Bookings" dataset using pandas' `read_csv()` function.
   - Display the initial rows of the dataset to understand its structure.

3. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Perform EDA using matplotlib and seaborn to visualize patterns.
   - Handle missing values using `isna().sum()` and visualize them with the `missingno` library.
   - Clean the data by filling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical formats.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze guest demographics, room prices, and seasonal booking patterns.
   - Visualize data using choropleth maps and box plots.

5. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Drop irrelevant columns, split data into numerical and categorical sets, and encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize numerical features to ensure consistency.

6. **Model Building and Evaluation**
   - Train various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, CatBoost Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, LGBM Classifier, and Voting Classifier.
   - Evaluate models using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification reports. Compare results to identify the most accurate model.

7. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
   - Convert target variables to categorical format using `to_categorical()` from Keras.
   - Build and train an ANN model using Keras, defining the model architecture, compiling it, and training with the dataset.
   - Visualize training and validation loss and accuracy.
   - Evaluate the ANN model using the test data and obtain the accuracy score.

8. **Model Comparison and Selection**
   - Create a dataframe to compare model performance and visualize results using a bar plot.

9. **Model Deployment and Usage**
   - Deploy the selected model and integrate it into hotel management systems.
