## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction

2. **Install Dependencies:**
 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 3. **Run the Data Preprocessing Script:**
    
   ```bash
   python data_cleaning.py
Train the Model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Evaluate the Model:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
üìä Data Exploration & Visualization
Scripts in this section help you understand the structure and relationships within the dataset through various visualizations. Use the scripts in data_exploration/ and data_visualization/ to explore and visualize the data.

üßπ Data Preprocessing
The data_cleaning.py script handles:

Removal of unnecessary variables.
Handling of missing values and outliers.
Feature selection and preparation.
üèóÔ∏è Model Building & Evaluation
Training
The train_model.py script uses logistic regression to build a predictive model. It splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the model, and saves it for later evaluation.

Evaluation
The evaluate_model.py script assesses the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. It also generates a confusion matrix and ROC curve for a visual representation of the model‚Äôs performance.
